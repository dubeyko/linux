	depends on BLOCK || MTD
	help
	  SSDFS experimental file system. The architecture of
	  file system has been designed to be the LFS file system
	  that can: (1) exclude the GC overhead, (2) prolong NAND
	  flash devices lifetime, (3) achieve a good performance
	  balance even if the NAND flash device's lifetime is a priority.

	  In its current state it is very experimental and should
	  not be used for other than testing purposes.

	  If unsure, say N.

	bool "SSDFS ZLIB compression support"

	default y
	help
	  Zlib is designed to be a free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered,
	  lossless data-compression library for use on virtually any computer
	  hardware and operating system. It offers a good trade-off between
	  compression achieved and the amount of CPU time and memory necessary
	  to compress and decompress. See <http://www.gzip.org/zlib/> for
	  further information.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  Select Zlib compression level.
	  Examples:
		     0  => Z_NO_COMPRESSION

	depends on SSDFS
	default n
	help
	  minilzo-based compression. Generally works better than Zlib.
	  LZO compression is mainly aimed at embedded systems with slower
	  CPUs where the overheads of zlib are too high.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SSDFS_DIFF_ON_WRITE

config SSDFS_CHECK_LOGICAL_BLOCK_EMPTYNESS
	bool "SSDFS check a logical block emptyness on every write"
	depends on SSDFS
	help
	  This option enables the technique of checking a logical block
	  emptyness on every write. The goal of this technique is
	  to prevent the re-writing pages with existing data because
	  SSD's FTL can manage this sutiation. However, this can be the
	  source of data and metadata corruption in the case of some
	  issues in file system driver logic. But it needs to take into
	  account that this technique could degrade the write performance
	  of file system driver. Also, file system volume has to be erased
	  during creation by mkfs. Otherwise, file system driver will fail
	  to write even for the case correct write operations.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SSDFS_DEBUG

	help
	  This option enables additional pre-condition and post-condition

	  environment for debugging code in SSDFS driver and excluding
	  debug checking from end-users' kernel build. This option enables
	  debug output by means of pr_debug() from all files too. You can
	  disable debug output from any file via the 'dynamic_debug/control'

	  This option enables accounting of memory allocation
	  (kmalloc, kzalloc, kcalloc, kmem_cache_alloc, alloc_page)
	  by means of incrementing a global counters and deallocation
	  (kfree, kmem_cache_free, free_page) by means decrementing
	  the same global counters. Also, there are special global counters
	  that tracking the number of locked/unlocked memory pages.
	  However, global counters have an unpleasant side effect.
	  If there are several mounted SSDFS partitions in the system
	  then memory leaks accounting subsystem is miscalculating
	  the number of memory leaks and triggers false alarms.
	  It makes sense to use the memory leaks accounting subsystem
	  only for single mounted SSDFS partition in the system.
