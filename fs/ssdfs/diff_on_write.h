 * The struct page has union with field "private" and related fields.

 * If ssdfs_write_begin() is called then it needs to copy current page
 * state into the backup memory page (this page should be shadowed inside
 * of "private" field). If ssdfs_write_end() is called then it needs
 * to extract diff (delta) and to save into structure is associated
 * with "private" field. Finally, gathered diffs are chained into
 * "private" field should be store during ssdfs_write_page() call.
